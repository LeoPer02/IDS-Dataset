## **Information about the dataset**

This files were acquired using the scripts on this project. It's important to know that the purpose of this script is simply to automate the process, the method applied to audit the process was one of pid>=x, which is a very non-precise way of filtering the results. 

With that said, every first file of each attack was gathered in interactive mode, and the following 9 on Repeat Mode, but only when available. In case of FTP, SSH and ReverseShell, interactive mode is not available and in Meterpreter repeat mode is not available so all results were gathered in Interactive mode.
